# Lessons Learned

- Early risk identification prevents delays
- Clear RACI improves accountability
- Regular communication ensures alignment

## What Worked Well

- Early risk identification and a clear Risk Response Plan reduced surprises during planning.
- A clear RACI matrix improved accountability and reduced confusion during decision‑making.
- Regular communication kept PM, IT, Operations, and Leadership aligned throughout the project.

## Opportunities for Improvement

- Introduce **blameless post‑incident reviews** after each major DR exercise or real incident to focus on learning rather than assigning blame.
- Track and report SRE‑style metrics such as mean time to recover (MTTR) and overall service availability to quantify DR effectiveness over time.
- Automate recurring DR tests where possible (e.g., scripted failover of non‑production environments) instead of relying only on table‑top exercises.
- Expand training so that more engineers and operators are comfortable executing runbooks without direct PM or senior engineer supervision.

## Next Steps

- Use insights from this project to refine future DR iterations, update runbooks, and adjust risk ratings based on actual test results.
